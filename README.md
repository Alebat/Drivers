# Drivers

A collection of drivers for various peripherals.

- __SIM800L.py__: a pure-MicroPython driver for the SIM800L GPRS module with both HTTP(S) GET and POST support. Works out of the box on the [TTGO T-Call SIM800 v1.3 board](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Call). Example usage starts at line 403, to run a demo just change the APN at line 427, then load the script on the board and run the "example_usage" function.

These drivers are the same we use in [PythingsOS](https://github.com/pythings/PythingsOS), if you are interested in an hassle-free solution to remoteely program your board and send some data to the cloud learn more at [pythings.io](https://pythings.io).
